Hello  Everyone,

I am pretty new to programming.  I took C++ in college and I was not very good at it  since I didn't study too hard at it.  I would love to learn to program so I can flag/code  data in databases automatically and then write comments/paragraphs explaining the codes/flags  to a  customer. 

I love to play golf and play Halo 5.
